# Data Mechanics take-home assignments for front-end engineers

Thanks for applying!

For the integrity of the process, please do not distribute or make public the assignment. Thank you!

## Context

At Data Mechanics, we provide our users with a dashboard to monitor and manage the Spark applications they run on our platform.

The user is interested in viewing basic information about their apps:

- what apps are currently running on the cluster, which ones are finished
- duration, start time, end time of their apps,
- the error message when an app failed,
- the log of the app

## Your task

Running `api/serve.sh` launches an API on `http://localhost:3000/` that exposes information about the apps running on a cluster.

Your mission is to build a dashboard web app that fetches information from the API and displays it in a neat way to the user.

### Description of the expected UI

The UI contains two logical units:

- the `apps` page lists all the applications running or recently run on the cluster
- the `app` page deep-dives on a specific application

#### `apps` page

It shows at a glance all the applications running or recently run on the cluster.

To provide a global idea of what is happening on the cluster, it makes sense for this page to feature pieces of information like:

- duration, start and end time (if applicable)
- state of the app (running, failed, completed)
- number of executors
- a delete button that kills a running application or erases a completed application from the dashboard (see API description)

#### `app` page

This page offers a more complete view of a Spark application.

It should contain the same information as the `apps` page regarding this application.
And additionally:

- the log of the Spark application
- the configuration (this is a JSON object that can be rendered as is to the user. For instance in a code block)

### Constraints and assumptions

- Do not provide an auth mechanism
- We'd prefer a React front-end, but ultimately if you feel more comfortable using another framework, please do it

### What we'll evaluate

- How you architect your code to be maintainable, readable and extendable
- How you manage to put yourself in the shoes of our data engineer end user and address his needs
- The overall look and usability of the front-end code

Please provide a README with next steps: improvement ideas, or features you find relevant but did not implement.
We'll take those into account in our evaluation!

Unit tests are not expected.

## Provided code

In a terminal, run

```bash
api/serve.sh
```

This launches an API on `http://localhost:3000/` with the following routes:

- `GET /api/apps/` that lists all apps
- `GET /api/apps/<appName>` that provides information about a single app
- `GET /api/apps/<appName>/log` that yields the log of a Spark application
- `DELETE /api/apps/<appName>` that deletes a Spark application

## API content

This is all the information available in the API about a Spark application:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/apps/appnexus-20191125-103438-fx777
```
