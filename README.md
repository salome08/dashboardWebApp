Hello,
this is the first time i use Next.js, i wanted to try so maybe i did not use the maximum capacities of this framework.
I also did a layout with fake data just for the style

# start

- `cd api`
- `sh api/serve.sh`
- `cd ../nextjs-client`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run start`

# To do more :

- Add some coding rules like ~Rbnb or else
- use typescript
- unit tests
- proptypes
- make folders with index for components despite despite of simple files to globalize imports
- create modal despite links
- scroll (infinite or pagination)
- global buttons
- css components
- use a store as context, or redux
